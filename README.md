# Gmail_Smart_Compose_Case_Study

# Introduction
If you are a Gmail user, by now you would have experienced the smart compose feature (maybe even without knowing you are actually using it). It's the new automatic sentence completion feature that takes email productivity to an exciting new level. It was released in Google I/O 2018.
Smart compose is smarter than you think, we engage in a lot of text-based communication on a daily basis. Most of the web and mobile apps today come with great features to improve productivity For instance, Whatsapp offers a predictive text, and Google search auto completes our queries with trending searches as you type in.

# Business problem
Here we have to make a model, which can predict the sentences or words based on the given sentence or some words. So here the input is a sequence of words and the output is also a sequence of words, so we have to build the sequence-based model.
